<h1> 3rd Party Authentication </h1>

## Introduction

In nowadays, there is a great need for federation among clouds ,fog or edge and provide authentication for security.
In this project, we will provide a universal federated authentication proxy to provide transparency to support cloud, edge, fog-OIDC and fog-802.1x sceaniros.
In order to be transparent, the federator plays roles of virtual counterparts to provide pairwise statefulness and translation and it does not require
any modifications in the existing authentication protocols.



## System specification:
 I had some problem when install freeradius in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, so please stick with 18.04.6 LTS.
